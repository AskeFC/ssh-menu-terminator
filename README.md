SSH Menu
========

SSH Menu is a SSH menu plugin for Terminator v1.9 (ie GTK3 based versions) or later.

Install
-------

Installing SSH Menu is as simple as copying ssh_menu.py to ~/.config/terminator/plugins/ .

How to use it
-------------

After copying ssh_menu to your terminator plugins dir and restarting Terminator, you should have a new 'SSH menu' option within the Terminator context menu. Selecting this menu option will open the SSH Menu window. From here you can use the 'Configure' button to add new SSH connection commands to the menu or launch an SSH session in your current tab by double-clicking on an existing SSH command.
